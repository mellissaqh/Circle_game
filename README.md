In this project I got to choose if I wanted to use Java or Kotlin. I chose Kotlin because I had never used Kotlin before and I wanted to learn it! I already knew Java from before, so it was fun to embark on this little journey to learn Kotlin! 
It is a game where circles appear in different colors and the user has to tap the circles with the right colors to make them dissapear. 
Hope you like it :)
